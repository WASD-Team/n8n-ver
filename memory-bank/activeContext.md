# Active Context

## Current focus
Build “ready mockups” directly in code (Next.js UI), using the real dataset shape from `test_version.csv` for realistic tables and flows.

## Next steps
- Scaffold Next.js app in `web/`
- Implement mock data loader reading a small subset of `test_version.csv`
- Build pages: Workflows list, Versions list, Version details, Diff
